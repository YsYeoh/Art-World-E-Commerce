# Art World Web Application

The **Art World Web Application** is a simple e-commerce platform designed specifically for the art community. Built with **ASP.NET**, this web app allows artists to showcase and sell their artwork to users. The application offers a seamless experience for both artists and buyers, allowing artists to upload their artwork and set details like price and description, while users can browse through the gallery, view artwork, and make purchases directly.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the requirements for my Bachelor's degree. The goal was to develop a web-based platform that serves as a gallery, where artists can showcase their work and connect with potential buyers. It is essentially an online marketplace for art, designed to facilitate the sale of specific items â€” in this case, original artwork and other art-related products.

## Key Features

- **Artist Submission Portal:** Artists can easily upload their artwork to the platform, providing details such as title, description, category, and price. They can also upload images of their artwork for users to view.

- **Gallery View:** Users can browse a wide range of artwork, filtered by different categories, price ranges, and other criteria. Each artwork is displayed with essential details, including the artist's name and price.

- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:** The app includes a shopping cart feature, allowing users to add artwork they are interested in purchasing. The checkout process is simple, allowing users to make payments and complete their purchase securely.

- **User and Artist Profiles:** Users can create accounts to manage their purchases and keep track of their favorite artworks. Artists can manage their uploaded artwork, monitor sales, and update their information.

- **Responsive Design:** The platform is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a smooth browsing and purchasing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core for the backend development, handling user authentication, gallery management, artist submissions, and order processing.

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

- **Database:** A relational database (such as SQL Server) is used to store user data, artwork information, and transaction records.

- **Payment Gateway:** The app integrates with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle secure transactions for purchasing artwork.

## Project Scope

The primary objective of this assignment was to develop a gallery app with e-commerce functionality. The app focuses on selling art, making it an ideal platform for artists to gain exposure and sell their pieces. This app is designed with simplicity in mind but includes the essential features for users to engage with artists and buy art easily.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the application is functional, future improvements could include:

- Adding more sophisticated filtering options for users (e.g., color, medium, artist).
- Implementing a review and rating system for artworks and artists.
- Expanding the payment options to support more gateways and currencies.
- Introducing a messaging system for users and artists to communicate directly.

## Conclusion

The **Art World Web Application** is a comprehensive project that combines e-commerce functionality with a focus on the art community. The platform serves as a bridge between artists and art lovers, providing a space for creative expression and the buying and selling of artwork.
